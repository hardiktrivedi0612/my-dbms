# my-dbms
This is a DBMS that I had created as one of my projects for Database Design course at University of Texas at Dallas.
This Database Management System works import, insert, select and delete for a fixed schema. 
The user can run the different SQL statements using a Command Line Interface and the results will be displayed appropriately.
